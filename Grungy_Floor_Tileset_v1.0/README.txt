Thank you for supporting me by downloading this asset pack! 

CONTENTS:
Note - The full tileset image technically makes up 32 [32x32] tiles, but the 4 chandelier frames are divided into 4 parts each, making them
64x64 at full size. Therefore, there are 20 unique assets in the set, and the package includes separated images of floor and chandelier sets.

- 1 full, 20-tile tileset with both floor and chandelier animation frames [32x32] (PNG)
- 1 floor-only tileset image [32x32] (PNG)
- 4 frames of chandelier animation only image [64x64] or [32x32] (PNG)
- Modular floor tile details:
    - 2 top/bottom edge variations
    - 4 corners
    - 1 dark inner edge and 1 light inner edge
    - 4 shadowy interior tiles
    - 1 lit bottom edge tile variation for chandelier lighting (flippable)


TILESET DETAILS:
- Tile size: 32x32 pixels
- Chandelier frame size: 32x32 or 64x64 (if you don't want to combine them into one image each)
- File format: PNG with transparency
- Vector-based and fully scalable (demos are shown at 3x scale)
- Optimized for rotation and flipping
- Background color for this pack:
    - HEX: '#30171b'
    - RGB: (48, 23, 27)


USAGE TIPS:
- Tiles are modular and designed to align seamlessly in Tiled or custom engines.
- Flip or rotate floor tiles for even better variation.
- Each chandelier frame in the full tileset is separated into four 32x32 parts. Each combines into a 64x64 tile. Use the provided chandelier-only tileset PNG if you do not wish to combine the frames yourself.
- For best results, use this pack over the background fill color or a similar hue.
- Pairs perfectly with my wall micro-pack with torch animation, the first in my Grungy Dungeon Tileset series! Download here: https://hypnobius.itch.io/grungy-wall-tiles
